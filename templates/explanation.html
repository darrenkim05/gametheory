        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            In this game, you’ll participate in a <strong>tournament</strong> modeled after Robert Axelrod’s studies on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma —
            a classic scenario in game theory where you repeatedly choose between two actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cooperate (C)</strong> – Help both players earn moderate points.</li>
            <li><strong>Defect (D)</strong> – Try to earn more for yourself, at the risk of harming both.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each round, you and an AI opponent will simultaneously choose to cooperate or defect.
            Your choices determine the score using the following payoff matrix:
        </p>
        <table class="table table-bordered" style="max-width: 600px;">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>You</th>
                    <th>Opponent</th>
                    <th>Your Score</th>
                    <th>Opponent Score</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>C</td><td>C</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>
                <tr><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr>
                <tr><td>D</td><td>C</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            You’ll face off against several opponents across 25 rounds each. Every opponent follows a different strategy — some kind, some ruthless, and some unpredictable.
            Your challenge: <strong>observe their behavior and adapt</strong> to score as highly as possible.
