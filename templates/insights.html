    <h2>ðŸ§  Axelrod's Insights from the Tournament</h2>
    <p>Robert Axelrodâ€™s famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments in the 1980s revealed how cooperation could emerge â€” even in a self-interested world. Hereâ€™s what he discovered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple strategies often win:</strong> Tit for Tat won by being easy to understand, nice, and retaliatory.</li>
        <li><strong>Being nice pays off:</strong> Strategies that avoided initiating defection generally performed better.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity is powerful:</strong> Simple, consistent behaviors encouraged cooperation more than complex ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgiveness helps:</strong> Forgiving strategies like Generous Tit for Tat earned more points long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation matters:</strong> Consistently fair strategies inspired cooperation from others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Tips to Score Well in This Game</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Observe your opponent early:</strong> Use the first few rounds to test their behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Start with cooperation:</strong> Many strategies reward kindness in the early rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Mirror consistency with consistency:</strong> Predictable opponents are often safest to cooperate with.</li>
        <li><strong>Punish betrayal, but donâ€™t overreact:</strong> Retaliate, but leave room for forgiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Adapt to the personality:</strong> Shift your approach based on how your opponent behaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Total points matter more than winning:</strong> You don't have to "beat" every opponent â€” just score well.</li>
    </ul>
