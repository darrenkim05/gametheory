        <h1>Welcome to My CS50 Final Project</h1>
        <p>
            For this project, I was inspired by <strong>Robert Axelrod’s famous tournaments</strong> on the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma —
            a foundational study in game theory. His work explored how cooperation could emerge in competitive environments,
            and I wanted to recreate and explore the system through code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this interactive simulation, you'll play a <strong>single-player tournament</strong> where you face off against various AI opponents.
            Each opponent uses a different strategy inspired by Axelrod’s original paper. In each match, you will play 25 rounds and choose
            to either <em>cooperate</em> or <em>defect</em>. Your goal? Maximize your total score by understanding and adapting to each opponent’s behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is designed to help you <strong>learn by doing</strong> — to experience firsthand the dynamics that made Axelrod’s research so influential.
